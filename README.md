# recruiter-linkedin-scraping-tool

This commissioned tool was used to scrap a unique recruiter interface of linkedin and format the information into the data entry system used internally. pdf2htmlex was used to convert the Linkedin PDF file into html. A combination of string manipulation and regex was then used to capture data. The data was then converted into Excel for easy import.
The conversion file is at /src/convert/htmlregexparser.py
